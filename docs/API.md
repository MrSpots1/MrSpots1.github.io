# API Documentation

## Overview

MrSpots1.github.io is a GitHub Pages repository hosting a static website. No backend API, CLI commands, or programmatic interfaces are present in the codebase. The repository consists solely of a `README.md` file serving as the landing page content.

**Design Philosophy**: As a static site, there are no dynamic APIs, endpoints, or server-side logic. Interaction is limited to viewing the rendered GitHub Pages site at https://MrSpots1.github.io.
