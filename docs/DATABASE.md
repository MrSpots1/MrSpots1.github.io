# Database Documentation

## No Database

This project ("MrSpots1.github.io") does not utilize a database. Based on the provided codebase (limited to `README.md`), it appears to be a static GitHub Pages site with no backend, server-side logic, or database integration. No schema, tables/collections, migrations, seeding scripts, or related configurations exist.

All other sections have been skipped as there is no database to document.
